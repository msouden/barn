I'm from Michigan originally, and a few friends and family in the more rural parts there have pole barns. They're big simple cheap buildings for stuff. Cars, wood shops, boats... that kind of stuff. I've always had a pole barn fantasy, but I live in Chicago. I don't have a lawn, let alone a mower or shed to put it in. 

When it comes to this software game though, there's always a project grabbing my attention. Being that GitHub seems like (among other things) at least in part, this developer's pole barn on occasion, I thought I'd use one of their Pages sites as the front door to my code barn. 

That's a long-winded way of saying this is really just a landing page and public-facing list of links to unfinished projects, repos I may have cloned and toyed with, and maybe some reference material and code snippets. Stuff not really portfolio-worthy, but for some reason needed to be accessible.

It's also powered by GitHub and Jekyll - a flat site - one with no (hackable) database.

It's written in markdown, then HTML is generated locally so only static pages are deployed to the server. It's different from how WordPress operates, an interesting idea, and a natural reaction to site bloat. So, I wanted to give it a spin. The build was also a nice little toe-dip into the Ruby world.
