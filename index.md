*Welcome to my Pole Barn*

I'm from Michigan originally, and a few friends and family there have pole barns. They're big simple cheap buildings. They often hold cars, wood shops, boats, RVs... that kind of stuff. I've had a pole barn fantasy on occasion, but I live in Chicago. I don't have a lawn, let alone a mower or shed to put it in.

When it comes to this software game though, there's always some mess of writing or code asking to be brought home and looked at. Being that GitHub is (among other things) in part, a sort of developer's pole barn (at least for me), I made this as a kind of side-door in.

That's a long-winded way of saying this is really just a landing page and public-facing list of links to unfinished projects, repos I may have cloned and toyed with, and maybe some reference material and code snippets. Stuff not really portfolio-worthy, but for some reason needed to be accessible.

It's also powered by GitHub and Jekyll - a flat site - one with no (hackable) database. It's written in markdown, then HTML is generated locally so only static pages are deployed to the server. It's different from how WordPress operates, an interesting idea, and a natural reaction to site bloat. So, I wanted to give it a spin. The build was also a nice little toe-dip into the Ruby world. 

To be continued...
