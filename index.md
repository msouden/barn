Pole barns are big simple cheap buildings for holding stuff. I've had a pole barn fantasy from time-to-time, but in Chicago, I don't have a lawn, let alone a mower or shed to put it in.

When it comes to this software game though, there's always some mess of writing or code asking to be brought home. Being that GitHub is (among other things) in part, a sort of developer's pole barn, I made this page as a kind of side-door into... stuff.

That's a long-winded way of saying this is really just a landing page for a public-facing list of links to unfinished projects, repos I may have cloned/starred/followed/toyed with, and maybe some reference material and/or code snippets. Stuff not really portfolio-worthy, but for some reason needed to be accessible.

The page/site itself makes use of Jekyll, so it's a flat site -  no database, written in markdown, with HTML generated locally and then uploaded to server. Very lean and secure compared to WordPress, but with limitations and intended for a more technically savvy user. I wanted to give it a spin and it made for a nice little toe-dip into the Ruby world. 

To be continued...
