I'm from Michigan originally, and in some parts, people have pole barns. They're big simple cheap buildings for holding stuff. I've had a pole barn fantasy from time-to-time, but in Chicago, I don't have a lawn, let alone a mower or shed to put it in.

When it comes to this software game though, there's always some mess of writing or code asking to be brought home. Being that GitHub is (among other things) in part, a sort of developer's pole barn, I made this page as a kind of side-door into... stuff.

That's a long-winded way of saying this is really just a landing page for a public-facing list of links to unfinished projects, repos I may have cloned/starred/followed/toyed with, and maybe some reference material and/or code snippets. Stuff not really portfolio-worthy, but for some reason needed to be accessible.

The page/site itself makes use of Jekyll, so it's a flat site -  no database, written in markdown, and HTML is generated locally so the server hosts just HTML. It's different from how WordPress operates. I wanted to give it a spin, and it made for a nice little toe-dip into the Ruby world. 

To be continued...
