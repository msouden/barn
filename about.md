Pole barns are big cheap buildings. I've had occasion to want a pole barn from time-to-time, but in Chicago I don't even have a shed.

When it comes to this software game though, there are a seemingly unlimited projects or scripts asking to be brought home, poked at, and usually abandoned. Instead scattering these over old backups, cloud archives, or tossed in a penholder/coffee mug, I'll use this as a sort of pole barn for code.  This is a side-door into that... stuff.

That's a long-winded way of saying this is just a space for public-facing links to unfinished projects, repos I may have cloned/starred/followed/toyed with, reference material, and code snippets. Stuff not really portfolio-worthy, but for some reason at some point I wanted to be accessible.

The page itself makes use of Jekyll, so it's a flat site -  no database, written in markdown, with HTML generated locally and then uploaded. Very lean and secure compared to WordPress, but with limitations. I wanted to give it a spin and it made for a nice little toe-dip into the Ruby world.
