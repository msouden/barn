Pole barns are big cheap buildings.

This is a sort of pole barn for words, links, and code I suppose. A place to put unfinished or old projects, repos, reference material, code snippets, etc. 

These pages make use of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}, so it's a flat site -  no database, written in markdown, with HTML generated locally and then uploaded. Very lean and secure compared to WordPress, but with limitations. I wanted to give it a spin and the setup made for a little refresher in the Ruby world.
